When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


library(readxl)
Lead <- read_excel("cindy/Lead.xlsx")
View(Lead)

## Part A
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Lead, aes(Smelter, IQ, colour = IQ)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("IQ Levels by Location Status")

## Part B

knitr::kable(Lead, "pipe")

## Part C

##Graph (Scatter Plot):
The scatter plot visually illustrates the relationship between IQ levels and smelter locations. 

##Table (Data Summary):
Each row in the table corresponds to a specific data point, displaying attributes such as smelter location and IQ score.

##Part D

mean_value <- mean(Lead$IQ)

print(mean_value)

##Part E

Lead[Lead$IQ == 999, "IQ"] <- 99

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Lead, aes(Smelter, IQ, colour = IQ)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("IQ Levels by Location Status")
  
knitr::kable(Lead, "pipe")
  
mean_value <- mean(Lead$IQ)

print(mean_value)
